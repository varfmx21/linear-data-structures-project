# Linear Data Structures Project

## Overview
This repository contains implementations of various linear data structures in C++. Linear data structures are data structures where elements are arranged sequentially, and each element is connected to its previous and next element.

## Features
- Implementation of different types of linear data structures such as:
    - Arrays
    - Linked Lists
    - Stacks
    - Queues
- Examples and test cases for each data structure.

## Installation
To use the code in this repository, clone it to your local machine using:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/varfmx21/linear-data-structures-project.git
